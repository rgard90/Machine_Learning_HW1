    "### Now when I look at the ratings it looks a little messy. Giving everything a rating out of 5 stars seems like an inefficient scoring scale to use in our data analysis. I would rather have it in percentage form, like a grade scale. That seems like a much easier way to understand the metric \"Rating\". So in the next cell I am going to multiply all the ratings by 20. If you were to multipy a perfect \"5-Star\" rating by 20 you would get a \"100%\" score so this is how I am converting the \"Ratings\" into percentages. "
